Clone the repo and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Then go [here](http://localhost:3000/graphql) for graphiQL where you can test queries and mutations.

Currently the mongo DB is running on mLab, if app fails to connect to DB go to index.js and change the address in mongoose.connect to your own DB instance of Mongo
